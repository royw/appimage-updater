ðŸ”§ Specific Refactoring Recommendations
Phase 1: Command Pattern Implementation
Extract CLI Commands - Create command classes for each CLI operation
Parameter Objects - Replace long parameter lists with data classes
Command Factory - Centralize command creation and validation
Phase 2: Service Layer Completion
ConfigurationService - Consolidate config operations
UpdateService - Handle update checking and downloading
ValidationService - Centralize validation logic
Phase 3: Complexity Reduction
Break down large functions in main.py, config_operations.py, display.py
Extract helper classes for complex operations
Implement strategy pattern for different update mechanisms
Phase 4: Architecture Cleanup
Facade implementation for simplified API
Dependency injection for better testability
Event system for progress reporting
ðŸ“ˆ Expected Benefits
Maintainability: Easier to understand and modify individual components
Testability: Isolated components with clear interfaces
Extensibility: New features can be added without modifying existing code
Code Quality: Reduced complexity ratings and improved readability
Team Productivity: Clearer separation of concerns for parallel development
ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps Priority
HIGH: Implement Command Pattern for CLI operations
HIGH: Create Facade for simplified API
MEDIUM: Complete Service Layer architecture
MEDIUM: Implement Strategy Pattern for update mechanisms
LOW: Add Observer Pattern for progress reporting
The codebase has a solid foundation with good patterns already emerging. The main focus should be on reducing the monolithic nature of main.py and completing the service layer architecture to achieve better separation of concerns and maintainability.
